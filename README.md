# Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm | Cryptography

This is a simple program to calculate the secret key using Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from nodejs.org.


## Getting Started


Step 1: Clone the Repository
        First, clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:


``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/adittya-jain/catalog-test.git
```


Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
        Once the repository is cloned, open the project directory by running:

```bash
cd catalog-test
```


Step 3: Install Dependencies
        Install all the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash 
npm install
```
        Note: Make sure Node.js is installed before running this command.

Step 4: Run the Project
        To start the program, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
    
Step 5: Provide the File Path
        After running the command, the program will ask for the path to the JSON file containing test cases. Two sample test cases (testcase1.json and testcase2.json) are provided. You can enter one of these filenames when prompted:

```bash
Please enter the file path: testcase1.json
```
        You can also create your own test case in a JSON file and provide the path to that file.

Output
        The program will display the secret key found in the JSON file.
